[Composer\Exception\NoSslException]
  The openssl extension is required for SSL/TLS protection but is not available. 
  If you can not enable the openssl extension, you can disable this error , at your own risk, 
  by setting the 'disable-tls' option to true.
 
-------------------------------
解决办法：
1、开启php-openssl
disable-tls#

Defaults to false. If set to true all HTTPS URLs will be tried with HTTP instead and 
no network level encryption is performed. Enabling this is a security risk and is NOT recommended. 
The better way is to enable the php_openssl extension in php.ini.

开启php扩展:	php_openssl

2、执行取消命令
composer config -g -- disable-tls true
