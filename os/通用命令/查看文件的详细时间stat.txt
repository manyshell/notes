关于对atime的详细说明：
atime updates are by far the biggest IO performance deficiency that Linux has today. 
Getting rid of atime updates would give us more everyday Linux performance than all 
the pagecache speedups of the past 10 years, _combined_.
As of 2.6.30 (9 June 2009), Linux defaults to relatime,[3] so that it will not update 
atime on all file reads. The behavior offers sufficient performance for most purposes 
and should not break any significant applications. Extended discussion of filesystem 

performance preceded the decision.[4] Indeed, relatime by default was the first patch 
Linux applied following the 2.6.29 release. In initial patches relatime only updated 
atime if atime < mtime or atime < ctime;
